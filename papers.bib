	abstract = {Improving walkability has the potential to play a major role in improving both accessibility and the public health dimensions of our cities. Walkability research to-date has focused on the inﬂuence of the built environment on physical activity associated with health and active transport outcomes. While the probable desirability of walkability to real estate value is recognised by the embedding of walkability indices such as WalkScore in property listing platforms, there is a paucity of research exploring this assumption. This research addresses this gap by undertaking an empirical study to quantify the economic value of walkability to residential property. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate the use of hedonic price modelling to test measures of walkability with a case study. We ﬁnd that WalkScore is positively related to prices for detached houses in Sydney, Australia but has no signiﬁcant relationship to unit prices. Possible reasons and directions for future work are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Colouring Australia is a digital platform for collecting and visualising building level information across several Australian cities. It provides a valuable resource for bringing together data on building age, material, sustainability ratings, walkability and other key metrics as we plan for net zero cities. Colouring Australia comprises part of the international Colouring Cities Research Programme, which supports the development of open-source platforms that provide open data on national building stocks. In this paper we outline the technical architecture of the platform, and the development and visualisation of a building level walkability metric based on pedestrian access to destinations. This platform provides a useful digital tool for planners to understand which parts of the city are walkable and in turn this can support future active transport programs and policies. Future research will be to validate this novel walkability index through a series of stakeholder and public workshops using the Colouring Australia platform in an interactive tabletop environment where usability testing can be undertaken.},

	abstract = {Cities often show residential income segregation, and the price of housing is generally related to employment accessibility, but how do these factors intersect? We analyse Greater Sydney, Australia, a metropolitan area of 5 million people. Sydney is found to have reasonably even employment accessibility by car, reﬂecting the increasingly polycentric nature of the modern city; however, it also shows considerable income segregation and variance in property prices between different parts of the city. Entropy is used to examine diversity and mixing of different income groups. Finally, hedonic price models using ordinary-least squares and geographically-weighted regression techniques show the differing effects of employment accessibility on house prices in different parts of the city. The results show that accessibility has small to negative effects on prices in the most valuable areas, suggesting that other effects such as recreational access and employment type/quality may be more important determinants of house prices in these areas.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we argue for an explicit decoupling of “walkability” and “walking behavior” and for the advantages of a definition of walkability based on access. This provides impetus for a new approach to constructing and using walkability indices, combining accessibility theory with a goal of comprehensiveness and communicability. Diminishing returns-toopportunities can be used to map the infinite origin-destination gravity potential space to a finite scale thus creating an easily communicable metric, or metrics. In addition, this method can be applied to any mode and applied to multiple destination types singly or combined. Application of this theoretical approach is demonstrated through the creation of a novel comprehensive open-source transport walking potential index, WalkTHERE. A 0-100 scale is used to represent the percentage of people’s total needs potentially accessible by walking. The index is applied to eight Australian and two European cities, and the specific data considerations and parameters chosen are described. Significant disparity is shown in walking access between different destinations within cities, and in walking access between cities. Walking access to recreational opportunities is highest, followed by education and shopping, with very little employment access for most residents. Avenues for expansion and further validation are discussed.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2024.104133},
	abstract = {We present a novel method for capturing citizens’ views on perceived walkability. Peoples’ de­cisions to use any transport mode are determined by perceived accessibility, thus perceived walkability is vital to the decision to walk for transport. To date, approaches to understanding perceived walkability, such as detailed ‘walkability audit’ instruments, have been difficult to scale and linked only to respondents’ residential locations. In contrast our research uses an online mapping tool designed to rapidly capture vague knowledge about places. Respondents use a map interface to spray-paint the most and least walkable areas across the city of Sydney, Australia, along with defining the area they regularly walk from home and where they would be willing to walk. They also provide free-text input to explain their responses. This approach enables data collection of respondents’ holistic understanding of the walkability of different areas based on the local knowledge and experience of the city. Pilot results together with qualitative analysis of text submitted in response to open ended questions are presented to demonstrate the feasibility, face validity and potential of the method. A comparison with an accessibility-based walkability index, WalkTHERE, for Sydney is shown. Results are broadly aligned, but the perceived walkability results presented highlight the negative environmental quality of walking near high-traffic roads and the positive aspects of natural and water views, which are not captured in this walkability index. Perceived walkable areas around the home were on average similar in overall area to the common standard of 15-minute buffers, but longer in their longest dimension, and have irregular shapes. Detailed methodology for analysis of the online mapping inputs is provided. This method has potential for rapid yet rich data collection, particularly when used together with a walkability model to understand differences which can point to localised problems with walking environment quality.},
